# SimulatedObjects

# NOTE: THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I PLAN TO MAINTAIN OR UPDATE, USE WITH THE EXPECTATION OF ISSUES

# Ideas
- Wind Volumes
- Different collider shapes
- Force Volumes of different shapes (Sphere, Box, Capsule)

# Goals
- Multiple colliders at once
- Better object support (supporting models, define the axis's of the root)
- Better performance than v1

ADD ID TO VOLUMES
REDUCE DT FOR OBJECTS FURTHER AWAY
