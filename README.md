# SimulatedObjects

# Ideas
- Wind Volumes
- Different collider shapes
- Force Volumes of different shapes (Sphere, Box, Capsule)

# Goals
- Multiple colliders at once
- Better object support (supporting models, define the axis's of the root)
- Better performance than v1

ADD ID TO VOLUMES

SimObjs -> Loop through colliders, check if theyre in radius of camera -> Get streaming jobs from colliders -> Stream out -> Do stream out jobs -> Stream in
